                <p style = "padding-right: 40px;">
                    My name is Sean Daniel Celerio and I am an undergrad pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. 
                    I have a deep passion for low-level programming, particularly using C and C++, and I am fascinated by computer architecture and electrical circuit design.
                    My academic journey in Texas A&M has led to my strong interest in understanding how hardware and software interact at the most fundamental levels.
                    I also enjoy working on hands-on projects that involve sensors and other small electronic devices, with a focus on maximizing utility and efficiency.
                    With that in mind, I hope to continually expand my knowledge and skills in these areas, contributing to the development of technology that is both innovative and practical.
