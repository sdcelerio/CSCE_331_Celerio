                <h1> 200Wh Battery Pack </h1>
                <h2> Ongoing since Spring 2024 </h2>
                <p style = "padding-left: 20px;"> 
                    A 3D printed battery pack with 15 18650 Li-Ion batteries that can provide up to 17.5 Ah of power, which can power up to 4 phones.
                    The battery pack features 4 USB-A ports, a 150 Watt AC wall port, wireless phones charging, and a variable DC port.
                    To function, the circuit ultilizes multiple relays, a power-inverter to convert DC to AC power, DC buck converter with constant current, 
                    and a BMS (Battery management system) chip to safetly charge the batteries.

                <p>
                    This PCB design was engineered for the "Mouseless Mouse", a glove-like device that functions like a mouse.
                    Furthermore, the device supports app functionality and a wireless connection through bluetooth.
                    A PCB design with a SEEED Studio Xiao Microcontroller combined with a BNO086 sensor. 
                    While powered, the sensor will send data to the microcontroller, which performs specific calculations and inputs to the machine it is connected to.
